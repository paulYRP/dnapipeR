Description: 
    A modular, reproducible R-based pipeline for Illumina EPIC and EPICv2 
    DNA methylation array preprocessing, quality control, cell-type deconvolution, 
    phenotype integration, and downstream statistical modelling. 
    The package provides wrappers for Minfi, WateRmelon, Enmix and Ewastool to accomplish 
    normalisation, probe filtering, cross-reactive probe removal, detection p-value QC, 
    surrogate variable analysis, and GLM/LME modelling across timepoints. 
    Designed to run seamlessly on Windows and HPC environments.
